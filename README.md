Title: Global Macroeconomic Indicators Analysis
Description: Multivariate analysis of global economic indicators (2010–2024) using PCA, clustering, and regression to reveal fiscal capacity, macroeconomic stability, and key drivers of government revenue across countries. Useful for revealing economic trends and patterns across geographic region and time, also to aid in policy-making

Insights & Findings: The analysis reveals that global fiscal performance is primarily shaped by three underlying macroeconomic dimensions. The first principal component (PC1) captures the scale and fiscal capacity of an economy—strongly influenced by GDP, tax revenue, and government expenditure—while the second (PC2) reflects inflationary and external balance dynamics, and the third (PC3) represents inflation–employment pressures. Countries with higher PC1 scores tend to have larger, more diversified economies and correspondingly higher government revenue ratios. In contrast, those with higher PC2 values (reflecting inflation volatility and weaker external positions) generally face fiscal instability.

Clustering analysis further distinguishes two structural groups: developed economies with high fiscal capacity and stability, and developing or inflation-sensitive economies with limited fiscal depth. This pattern confirms that fiscal resilience is linked to both economic scale and monetary discipline. Regression modeling supports these findings — ensemble models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting outperform linear regressions (R² ≈ 0.93 vs. 0.80), indicating non-linear interactions between fiscal and macroeconomic variables.

Overall, the study highlights that sustainable fiscal performance arises from the balance of economic size, price stability, and effective fiscal institutions. Countries combining robust growth with inflation control and efficient revenue systems tend to maintain higher, more stable government revenues, while those exposed to monetary volatility experience fiscal erosion over time.

AI Support Explanation: This project demonstrates how AI and machine learning can enhance macroeconomic insight and fiscal analysis. By applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the model automatically detected underlying structures among 14 highly correlated economic indicators, reducing dimensionality without losing explanatory power. Clustering algorithms (K-Means) then grouped countries based on these latent features, allowing the AI to uncover fiscal and structural similarities between economies that traditional analysis might overlook.

The machine learning regression models—especially ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting—provided predictive accuracy far beyond standard econometric approaches (R² ≈ 0.93). These AI models learned complex, non-linear relationships between variables such as GDP, inflation, and government revenue, helping to identify how combinations of fiscal capacity, monetary stability, and price pressure jointly affect fiscal outcomes.

In essence, AI acted as an analytical amplifier: PCA revealed structure, clustering exposed patterns, and machine learning quantified relationships. Together, they enabled data-driven interpretation of global fiscal dynamics—showing that economies balancing size, stability, and efficient taxation achieve stronger, more sustainable revenue performance.
